<p>
  This is a small project of mine dedicated to solving one problem which was, If we have multiple Word files and we want to convert each one of them to separate PDF files we need to upload each file one by one and wait for each file to convert into a PDF file. With this code, we can select as many Word files and Python will automatically convert them into a PDF by using threads.

## How to use this script

Simply clone my Github repository and upload your files into the 'Word Files' folder located next to the word_to_pdf.py file. You can also change the path of your files.
