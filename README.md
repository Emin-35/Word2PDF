<p>
    This is a small project of mine dedicated to solving one problem which was, If we have multiple Word files and we want to convert each one of them to  separate PDF files we need to upload each file one by one and wait for each file to convert into a PDF file. With this code, we can select as many Word    files and Python will automatically convert them into a PDF by using threads.
</p>
<p>
  With the new version, you can also convert between Word files to PDF files, Image files to PDF files and Merge multiple PDF files. I also added a GUI  so users can easily use this project.

## How to use this script

Simply clone my Github repository and upload your files into the 'Word Files' folder or uploade your images into the 'Image Files'. Import the libraries and run `main_interface.py` file. You can also change the path of your files.
